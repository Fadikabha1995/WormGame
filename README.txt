The is the old Worm game that we was playing it by old nokia phones.
you can control the worm by the keyboard direction keys and it start going
in a normal speed once it eats 15 apples every time it will speed up lettel bit

everytime you eat an apple the worm goes to be much more tall.

also every time you eat an apple the next random location apple will be in a random
color.

if the worm touched it self or touched the wall "frame" the game goes game over
and then you will receive a new frame with two options:
1.start the game again.
2.close and quit the game

i still working on the game to make it has 3 levels of difficulties
"Easy,Meduim,Hard"

Thanks for using my code
